# Single wing sail

The point of this example is to demonstrate how a single element wing sail can be simulated using the lifting line functionality in Stormbird. 

The simulations are executed in three different modes, to compare the output against each other. This is to demonstrate how the results are affected by different simplifications and corrections.

The results are compared against the same [experimental results](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0029801814002637?via%3Dihub) as for the [section model example](../1 - section models/), but in this case the 3D model. Note: the stall characteristics of the foil model is changed from the 2D example. This is typically necessary for getting a good match. Stall is complicated, and reproducing the exact same stall behavior in 3D do require some tuning on the input 2D model.
