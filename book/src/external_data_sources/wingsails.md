## Experiments

### 1996 - The CFD assisted design and experimental testing of a wing-sail with high lift devices

**Author**: D. W. Atkins

**Short summary**: Experimental tests of multiple sectional configurations. CFD data is also presented, but deemed by the author to "not [be] sufficiently accurate to be used quantitatively". Nevertheless, the experimental data seems useful for setting up sectional models.

### 2014 - Comparison of full 3D-RANS simulations with 2D-RANS/lifting line method calculations for the flow analysis of rigid wings for high performance multihulls

**Authors**: K. Graf, A.v. Hoeve, S. Watin

**Short summary**: The paper presents results from CFD and lifting line simulations of a wing sail using a two-element section. Values for lift and drag are presented for both the full three-dimensional wing and for a two dimensional section. The CFD setup is also verified against experimental data for a single element wing sail, with good results. The match between the lifting line and CFD results are found to be good at angles of attack before stall, but the lifting line method struggles with instabilities when the flap angle and angle of attack is large at the same time, i.e., when the lift is too high close to the maximum lift angle. Maximum lift coefficients for the sectional models are found to be approximately 2.5 

Can be used for both validation of models and for tuning the sectional model data.

### 2020 - Numerical Investigation of a Two-Element Wingsail for Ship Auxiliary Propulsion

**Authors**: Chen Li, Hongming Wang, Peiting Sun

**Short summary**: The paper presents CFD results mostly of a two-dimensional section consisting of two elements. Lift as a function of flap angle and angle of attack is shown. The maximum lift coefficient for the two-dimensional section is approximately 2.4
