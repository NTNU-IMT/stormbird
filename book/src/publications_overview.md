# Publications using Stormbird

This section contains an overview of publications that either use Stormbird directly, or use an earlier version of the same methods that Stormbird are built on from the developers of Stormbird. These references are recommended as additional reading material to get an overview of the capabilities of the library.

## Conference articles
### 2023 - Actuator line for wind propulsion modelling
**Authors**: Jarle Vinje Kramer and Sverre Steen

**Short summary**: Compares CFD, lifting line and actuator line simulations against each other for a case that includes two wing sails in close proximity. The actuator line simulations also contains the effect of a superstructure.

## Journal articles
### 2022 - Sail-induced resistance on a wind-powered cargo ship
**Authors**: Jarle Vinje Kramer and Sverre Steen

**Short summary**: A larger article that was really about the hydrodynamic modelling of wind-powered ships. However, an early version of the lifting line method implemented in Stormbird was also used for the sail modelling. It contains a simple validation experiment that compares lifting line simulations against CFD.
