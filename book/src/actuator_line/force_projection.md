# Force projection

The forces calculated on each line segment need to be projected back onto the CFD grid as body force to deflect the flow in as similar way as possible to a real wing. In other words, lift-induced velocities in an actuator line model is modeled through these body forces.

There are a few different ways to project these forces, and the choice of method can have a significant effect on the final results.
