# Actuator line

An actuator line model shares a lot of the same principles a lifting line model; the wings are divided into line segments, and the forces on each line segment are dependent on the local velocity and the sectional models. However, unlike a lifting line simulation, there is no potential theory wake. The velocity at each control point is instead estimated directly from the velocity field in a CFD solver. The benefit of this is that other structures may influence the felt velocity at each control point. For the sake of sail simulations, this allows for modelling the interaction effects between the deck and superstructure and the sails.
