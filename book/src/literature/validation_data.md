# Validation data

This chapter contains useful references for extracting data about the lift and drag on different wind propulsion devices, that, for instance, can be used to validate a simulation setup.

The most relevant comparison data are from methods that can be considered to be *higher fidelity* than the methods in Stormbird. In other words, the articles below is mostly methods that contain data from either CFD, experiments, or some type of processing of full-scale measurements.

Although there are probably many ways to compare different data sources, the focus is mostly on articles that provide data on *lift and drag*, as this is believed to be the most straight forward data to use when validating a setup.

For each sail category, there is first a list of papers, with a short recap of the content. Then, a comparison of the data in all papers are plotted.

## Wing sails

## Rotor sails

## Suction sails

## Kites
