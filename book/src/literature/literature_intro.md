# Literature

This chapter gives references to relevant literature that can serve as useful additional reading when working with the Stormbird models.

The chapter is divided into two sub-chapters:

1) [Simulation methods](similar_simulation_methods.md) contains references to papers that cover similar or identical methods as the ones implemented in Stormbird. That is, papers covering lifting line and actuator line methods.
2) [Validation data](validation_data.md) contains references to papers that provide data that can be used to validate the output from Stormbird simulations. That is, generally experimental data or high-fidelity CFD simulations of wind propulsion devices.
