### 2023 - Actuator line for wind propulsion modelling
**Authors**: Jarle Vinje Kramer and Sverre Steen

**Short summary**: Compares CFD, lifting line and actuator line simulations against each other for a case that includes two wing sails in close proximity. The actuator line simulations also contains the effect of a superstructure.

### 2022 - Sail-induced resistance on a wind-powered cargo ship
**Authors**: Jarle Vinje Kramer and Sverre Steen

**Short summary**: A larger article that was really about the hydrodynamic modelling of wind-powered ships. However, an early version of the lifting line method implemented in Stormbird was also used for the sail modelling. It contains a simple validation experiment that compares lifting line simulations against CFD.
