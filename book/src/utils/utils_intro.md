# Other functionalities

The library also contains several helper functionalities that model things that are useful for wind propulsion simulations, but that, technically speaking, is not parts of either the lifting line or actuator line methods. These functionalities are described in this chapter.

This chapters is, however, still under construction. The plan is to extend the sub-chapters with **more details "soon"**.
