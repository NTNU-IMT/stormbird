# Run Vesim and Stormbird together
This folder contains example files for running Stormbird together with models generated by ShipX, 
and Vesim. 

The example will not work unless the same models as the example files are generated
by your local ShipX install. However, the purpose is to show how this can be achieved in a general 
way. 

## Steps to reproduce this setup for another model
### Ensure Vesim models can be executed by OSP
To allow the exported FMU-model to be executed by an external model, the `SINTEF_FMU_CRT_DIR`
environmental variable must be set to point to the binaries folder of the ShipX FMUs.

This can be found in: `[shipx-folder]/`
